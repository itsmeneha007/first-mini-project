    <h1>My Daily Routine</h1>
    <p>I believe in maintaining a balanced and productive daily routine. I start my day at 5:30 AM with meditation and light stretching exercises. This helps me stay calm and focused throughout the day. 

        After a healthy breakfast, I plan my goals using a digital planner and prioritize my tasks. My work/study hours are from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM, during which I follow the Pomodoro technique to enhance my concentration and productivity.

        I reserve evenings for learning new skills, reading, and networking. I also maintain a habit of journaling before bed to reflect on the day and express gratitude. Consistency in my daily habits helps me stay disciplined, productive, and motivated.
